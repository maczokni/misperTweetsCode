# misperTweetsCode
This is the code to accompany the paper 'Exploring public engagement with missing person appeals on Twitter.' 

It is wrapped up in a package, you can download directly from here with `devtools::install_github("maczokni/misperTweetsCode")`.

There is also the Rmarkdown document for the paper in the repo it is final_paper.Rmd. However this will not knit without access to the data, which I need to anonymise before I can share. But it shows any additional code I used to generate the results. 

I will add more description to this ASAP!!!
